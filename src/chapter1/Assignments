1. Write a program that reads an integer and prints it in binary, octal, and hexadecimal. Print the reciprocal as a hexadecimal floating-point number.

2. Write a program that reads an integer angle (which may be positive or negative) and normalizes it to a value between 0 and 359 degrees. Try it first with the % operator, then with floorMod.

3. Using only the conditional operator, write a program that reads three integers and prints the largest. Repeat with Math.max.

4. Write a program that prints the smallest and largest positive double values. Hint: Look up Math.nextUp in the Java API.

5. What happens when you cast a double to an int that is larger than the largest possible int value? Try it out.

6. Write a program that computes the factorial n! = 1 × 2 × ... × n, using BigInteger. Compute the factorial of 1000.

7. Write a program that reads in two integers between 0 and 4294967295, stores them in int variables, and computes and displays their unsigned sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder. Do not convert them to long values.

8. Write a program that reads a string and prints all of its nonempty substrings.

10. Write a program that produces a random string of letters and digits by generating a random long value and printing it in base 36.

11. Write a program that reads a line of text and prints all characters that are not ASCII, together with their Unicode values.

12. Write a switch expression that, when given a string with a compass direction "N", "S", "E", or "W", yields an array of x- and y-offsets. For example, "W" should yield new int[] { -1, 0 }.

13. Write a switch statement that, when given a string with a compass direction "N", "S", "E", or "W", adjusts the variables x and y. For example, "W" should decrement x by 1.

14. Can you use a break in a switch statement without fall-through? In a switch expression? Why or why not?

15. Come up with a useful scenario where the fall-through behavior is beneficial for a switch expression or statement. Most web searches will produce examples that make sense for C or C++, where execution falls from case A with no action to case B. In Java, that is not significant because you can use case A, B.

16. A “Quine” is a program that, without reading any input or file, prints its own source code. Write such a program in Java, using a text block.

17. The Java Development Kit includes a file src.zip with the source code of the Java library. Unzip and, with your favorite text search tool, find usages of the labeled break and continue sequences. Take one and rewrite it without a labeled statement.

18. Write a program that prints a lottery combination, picking six distinct numbers between 1 and 49. To pick six distinct numbers, start with an array list filled with 1...49. Pick a random index and remove the element. Repeat six times. Print the result in sorted order.

19. Write a program that reads a two-dimensional array of integers and determines whether it is a magic square (that is, whether the sum of all rows, all columns, and the diagonals is the same). Accept lines of input that you break up into individual integers, and stop when the user enters a blank line. For example, with the input

16 3 2 13
5 10 11 8
9 6 7 12
4 15 14 1
(Blank line)
your program should respond affirmatively.

20. Write a program that stores Pascal’s triangle up to a given n in an ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>.

21. Improve the average method so that it is called with at least one argument.
